# Deadline

## Usage

Using **Deadline** is simple. Once you've installed it in your repository you will need to setup your `.github/setup.yml` file and **Deadline** will do the rest.

## Configuring for your project

There are a couple of configuration options that you will need to setup depending on what you want.

```yml

-
  label: development
  time: Friday at 2pm
  comment: You've missed the deadline
-
  label: version
  time: Thursday at 2pm
  comment: release is done
```

## Setup

```sh
# Install dependencies
npm install

# Run the bot
npm start
```
